        <p>At Karakunku Farm, we are dedicated to supporting local farmers through training and innovative irrigation systems. Our goal is to enhance food security and environmental sustainability. 

            PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The Gambia faces increasing food insecurity, with rural areas such as Basse, Janjanbureh, Jarra and Kuntuar being hit hardest. More than half of rural households (52%) are food insecure, and they are more vulnerable to climate-related shocks. Rising food prices, driven by global events, coupled with inflation and increased utility costs, exacerbate the difficulties for rural farmers. These households struggle with climate impacts and have limited access to modern agricultural techniques, further constraining their productivity and livelihoods. 

            

            SOLUTION STATEMENT:
Karakunku Farm addresses these critical challenges by providing solar-powered automated drip irrigation technology, which enhances water efficiency and productivity for smallholder farmers. Since its inception in 2019 and formal registration in 2020, Karakunku Farm has focused on promoting sustainable food production. Despite initial setbacks in 2022 due to lack of experience, financial support, and market knowledge, the lessons learned by founder Lamin Ceesay have enabled the company to refine its approach. By producing vegetables, selling drip irrigation systems and offering farmer awareness programs and training, Karakunku Farm aims to empower farmers to adapt and mitigate climate change and increase their food security. 
            
Karakunku Farm’s innovative solutions have gained recognition, winning three continental awards in Africa, highlighting the impact and potential of its approach. These accolades have bolstered its credibility, positioning the farm as a leader in sustainable agriculture and a key contributor to tackling food insecurity in The Gambia’s rural areas. .</p>
